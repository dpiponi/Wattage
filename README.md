# Wattage
A small library for working with formal power series.
Supports both univariate and multivariate power series.
Multivariate power series are basically univariate power series where the coefficient of x‚Åø is a homogeneous polynomial of total degree n.

See `examples/` for examples for things like:

  * `ex1`: computing Gromov-Witten invariants
  * `ex2`: computing numbers of heaps of tetris-like pieces
  * `ex3`: counting numbers of walks on lattices
